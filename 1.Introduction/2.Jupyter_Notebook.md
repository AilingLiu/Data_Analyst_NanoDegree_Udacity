  Slides are full slides that you move through left to right. Sub-slides show up in the slideshow by pressing up or down. Fragments are hidden at first, then appear with a button press. You can skip cells in the slideshow with Skip and Notes leaves the cell as speaker notes.

- Running the slideshow
To create the slideshow from the notebook file, you'll need to use nbconvert:

    `jupyter nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to slides`

This just converts the notebook to the necessary files for the slideshow, but you need to serve it with an HTTP server to actually see the presentation.

To convert it and immediately see it, use

`jupyter nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to slides --post serve`

This will open up the slideshow in your browser so you can present it.
