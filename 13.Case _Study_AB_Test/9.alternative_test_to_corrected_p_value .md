# alternative test to corrected p value

Since the Bonferroni method is too conservative when we expect correlation among metrics, we can better approach this problem with more sophisticated methods, such as the [closed testing procedure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_testing_procedure), [Boole-Bonferroni bound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_bound), and the [Holm-Bonferroni method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holm%E2%80%93Bonferroni_method). These are less conservative and take this correlation into account.

If you do choose to use a less conservative method, just make sure the assumptions of that method are truly met in your situation, and that you're not just trying to [cheat on a p-value](http://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/19817). Choosing a poorly suited test just to get significant results will only lead to misguided decisions that harm your company's performance in the long run.
