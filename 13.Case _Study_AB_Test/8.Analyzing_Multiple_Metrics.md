# Analyzing Multiple Metrics

### Bonferroni Correction
If you remember from the previous lesson, the [Bonferroni Correction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction) is one way we could handle experiments with multiple tests, or metrics in this case. To compute the new bonferroni correct alpha value, we need to divide the original alpha value by the number of tests.
