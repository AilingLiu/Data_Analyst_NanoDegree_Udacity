# Metric - Average Reading Duration

Again, let's recap the steps we took to analyze the results of this A/B test.

1. We computed the observed difference between the metric, average reading duration, for the control and experiment group.
2. We simulated the sampling distribution for the difference in means (or average reading durations).
3. We used this sampling distribution to simulate the distribution under the null hypothesis, by creating a random normal distribution centered at 0 with the same spread and size.
4. We computed the p-value by finding the proportion of values in the null distribution that were greater than our observed difference.
5. We used this p-value to determine the statistical significance of our observed difference.
