# Experiment I

The first change Audacity wants to try is on their homepage. They hope that this new, more engaging design will increase the number of users that explore their courses, that is, move on to the second stage of the funnel.

The metric we will use is the click through rate for the Explore Courses button on the home page. Click through rate (CTR) is often defined as the the number of clicks divided by the number of views. Since Audacity uses cookies, we can identify unique users and make sure we don't count the same one multiple times. For this experiment, we'll define our click through rate as:

CTR: # clicks by unique users / # views by unique users

Now that we have our metric, let's set up our null and alternative hypotheses:

Null: CTR-New is less or equal to CTR-Old
Alternative: CTR-New is greater than CTR-old​


Our alternative hypothesis is what we want to prove to be true, in this case, that the new homepage design has a higher click through rate than the old homepage design. And the null hypothesis is what we assume to be true before analyzing data, which is that the new homepage design has a click through rate that is less than or equal to that of the old homepage design. As you’ve seen before, we can rearrange our hypotheses to look like this:

Null: CTR-New - CTR-Old <= 0
Alternative: CTR-New - CTR-old > 0
